I’m a mathematician  and former athlete 🏀 turned [Data Scientist 📊 🧪 @ Zelus Analytics](https://www.zelusanalytics.com/) specializing in Basketball and Hockey R&D. 

For years, I’ve been building and refining predictive models, applying Bayesian statistics, machine learning, time series analysis, and spatial modeling in a variety of projects, from public health initiatives to frame by frame models in sports.

Currently, I’m researching and working in sports quantitative analysis (and pursuing a PhD 🇩🇪).

I’m particularly interested in the intersection of computing and mathematics, exploring how descriptive and predictive modeling can drive insights in sports, physics, and biology.

[Co-Founder and Organizer of ITAM Sports Analytics](https://itam-sports-analytics-conference.github.io/)

Native R speaker but will do Python for food. 

Zenyatta main.
