Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

‚öΩÔ∏è[Penalty Shootout Analysis]()
<br> 
Developed mixed effects models to analyze penalty kicks in World Cup shootouts, examining factors such as psychological stress, dominant foot, and the advantage of shooting first.

üèÄ [Application of Regularized Regression Methods to forecast the NBA Playoffs & Trade Evaluation Scenarios.](https://github.com/pablolopez2733/NBA-Forecast/blob/main/reports/Tesis_PabloLopezLanderos.pdf)
<br> 
This is my undergrad thesis. Using regularized regression methods, we implement an improvement over the traditional plus-minus metric. We then explore the predictive value of our model by forecasting the outcome of the 2015 playoffs.

üèà [A ggplot implementation for plotting NFL player tracking data.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pablollanderos33/generate-play-animations-with-ggplot)
<br> 
Using ggplot and based on previous work by Adam Sonty, I created a set of functions to plot NFL tracking data.

üèí [Projecting Win Probability in Women's Hockey](https://github.com/Echeney17/BigDataCup2021/blob/main/bdc_WP.pdf)
<br> 
For our Big Data Cup entry, we adapted a soccer metric called Expected Threat (xT) to Hockey and used it to calculate Win Probability in Women's Hockey.
