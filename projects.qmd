Over the course of my career, I‚Äôve worked on a variety of projects from sports to public health. Here are a few highlights.

***

‚öΩÔ∏è[Penalty Shootout Analysis]()
<br> 
Developed mixed effects models to analyze penalty kicks in World Cup shootouts, examining factors such as psychological stress, dominant foot, and the advantage of shooting first.

üèÄ [Application of Regularized Regression Methods to forecast the NBA Playoffs & Trade Evaluation Scenarios.](https://github.com/pablolopez2733/NBA-Forecast/blob/main/reports/Tesis_PabloLopezLanderos.pdf)
<br> 
This is my undergrad thesis. Using regularized regression methods, we implement an improvement over the traditional plus-minus metric. We then explore the predictive value of our model by forecasting the outcome of the 2015 playoffs.
