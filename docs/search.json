Por eso las mejores están en números negativos. pic.twitter.com/eQRxTFoumH\n\n— Pablo L. Landeros (@Landeros_p33) October 30, 2020\n\n\n\n🔷 Using Poisson Distribution and scoring rates to predict Liga MX quarter-finals  Using Poisson Distribution, betting market odds and Expected Goals; I predicted the probability of different outcomes for the quarter finals of the mexican soccer league.\n\n\n📊 Usando Poisson, Simulación Monte Carlo y ajustando con Expected Goals y momios de casas de apuestasVan predicciones de resultados y ganadores para la ida de los cuartos de final de la @LigaBBVAMX Ganadores:⚽️Atlas⚽️Tigres⚽️Pachuca⚽️AmericaPredicciones de marcador: pic.twitter.com/gm1diPTp19\n\n— Pablo L. Landeros (@Landeros_p33) May 11, 2022\n\n\n\n🔷 Has the NFL become more entertaining in recent years?  A quick analysis on play by play data revealed that NFL Football has become a more entertaining sport than it was 20 years ago.\n\n\n.@reinhurdler posted that this NFL week was particularly boring (and he was right) Then @Unmalkicker suggested it would be interesting to see yearly evolution of data to see if it is becoming a more entertaining sport. Turns out, the NFL is SLIGHLTY more fun in recent years. pic.twitter.com/qdijTN4vf7\n\n— Pablo L. Landeros (@Landeros_p33) October 27, 2021\n\n\n\n🔷 Comeback Probability using Monte Carlo Simulation  Using Poisson distribution and Monte Carlo simulation, I predicted the probability of UNAM coming back from a 4 goal deficit against Cruz Azul in the Mexican Cup semifinals. Our predicted probabilities matched those published by betting sites.\n\n\n⚽️Usando Simulación Monte Carlo + la idea de @migueldva de ajustar una distribución Poisson para simular partidos de futbol. ⚽️📊Nos aventamos 10,000 simulaciones para estimar cuáles eran las probabilidades de que @PumasMX avanzara a la final: pic.twitter.com/zzR1nIMX4V\n\n— Pablo L.

What is the probability that none of them get out of the elevator in the first two floors? Through simulation, we can get an answer.\n\n\nAquí están mis códigos en #RStats y según yo la probabilidad de que nadie baje en los primeros dos pisos es de 6.59 % 😋Mañana lo intento con Monte Carlo a ver que sale.Dejo mi repo de Github por si alguien le interesa:https://t.co/bvsXIrcB0f https://t.co/4StVkn6r9Z pic.twitter.com/OBS3WXOBOe\n\n— Pablo L.
