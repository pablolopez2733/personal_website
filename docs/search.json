Por eso las mejores est√°n en n√∫meros negativos. pic.twitter.com/eQRxTFoumH\n\n‚Äî Pablo L.

A quick analysis on play by play data revealed that NFL Football has become a more entertaining sport than it was 20 years ago.\n\n\n.@reinhurdler posted that this NFL week was particularly boring (and he was right) Then @Unmalkicker suggested it would be interesting to see yearly evolution of data to see if it is becoming a more entertaining sport. Turns out, the NFL is SLIGHLTY more fun in recent years. pic.twitter.com/qdijTN4vf7\n\n‚Äî Pablo L.

Our predicted probabilities matched those published by betting sites.\n\n\n‚öΩÔ∏èUsando Simulaci√≥n Monte Carlo + la idea de @migueldva de ajustar una distribuci√≥n Poisson para simular partidos de futbol. ‚öΩÔ∏èüìäNos aventamos 10,000 simulaciones para estimar cu√°les eran las probabilidades de que @PumasMX avanzara a la final: pic.twitter.com/zzR1nIMX4V\n\n‚Äî Pablo L.

What is the probability that none of them get out of the elevator in the first two floors? Through simulation, we can get an answer.\n\n\nAqu√≠ est√°n mis c√≥digos en #RStats y seg√∫n yo la probabilidad de que nadie baje en los primeros dos pisos es de 6.59 % üòãMa√±ana lo intento con Monte Carlo a ver que sale.Dejo mi repo de Github por si alguien le interesa:https://t.co/bvsXIrcB0f https://t.co/4StVkn6r9Z pic.twitter.com/OBS3WXOBOe\n\n‚Äî Pablo L.
