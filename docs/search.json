    "text": "Here are some of the projects I have worked on:\n🏈 A ggplot implementation for plotting NFL player tracking data.  Using ggplot and based on previous work by Adam Sonty, I created a set of functions to plot NFL tracking data.\n\n\n🏒 Projecting Win Probability in Women’s Hockey  For our Big Data Cup entry, we adapted a soccer metric called Expected Threat (xT) to Hockey and used it to calculate Win Probability in Women’s Hockey. \n\n🏀 Application of Regularized Regression Methods to forecast the NBA Playoffs & Trade Evaluation Scenarios.  This is my undergrad thesis. Using regularized regression methods, we implement an improvement over the traditional plus-minus metric. We then explore the predictive value of our model by forecasting the outcome of the 2015 playoffs.   \n\n💻 Quarto Tutorial for beginners  As part of an introductory R course for health workers taught by Rodrigo Zepeda and me, I created a Quarto tutorial which covers report generation in Word and HTML.   \n\n⚽ Soccer Simulator  A tool for simulating soccer matches using Poisson distro + Monte Carlo Simulation. Still a WIP!  \n\n🦠 Estimating COVID-19 cases using contact index   I am currently working with Rodrigo Zepeda and Guillermo de Anda on implementing a series of models for estimating effective reproductive number of COVID-19 for Mexico City using Contact Index and different time series methods. \nBecause the models are still a work in progress, the repo is not yet publicly available :(\n\n🍜 Random restaurant decider  R codes for running a random walk and randomly selecting which restaurant to dine at :)  \n\n🔐 Vigenere Cyphering App  Created and deployed a web app for encrypting and deciphering messages using vigenere ciphering.  \n\n⚽ Are penalties really a coin toss?  A statistical analysis of penalty kicks taken in World Cups found that the most frequent zone (bottom left) is also the lowest in terms of goal percentage. For goalkeepers, the best strategy might be not to dive at all.  viz by: Jeffrey Braun\n\n🦠 Vizualizing COVID 19 spread  Code for generating interactive maps that track the global spread of Coronavirus since March 2020."

Por eso las mejores están en números negativos. pic.twitter.com/eQRxTFoumH\n\n— Pablo L. Landeros (@Landeros_p33) October 30, 2020\n\n\n\n🔷 Using Poisson Distribution and scoring rates to predict Liga MX quarter-finals  Using Poisson Distribution, betting market odds and Expected Goals; I predicted the probability of different outcomes for the quarter finals of the mexican soccer league.\n\n\n📊 Usando Poisson, Simulación Monte Carlo y ajustando con Expected Goals y momios de casas de apuestasVan predicciones de resultados y ganadores para la ida de los cuartos de final de la @LigaBBVAMX Ganadores:⚽️Atlas⚽️Tigres⚽️Pachuca⚽️AmericaPredicciones de marcador: pic.twitter.com/gm1diPTp19\n\n— Pablo L. Landeros (@Landeros_p33) May 11, 2022\n\n\n\n🔷 Has the NFL become more entertaining in recent years?  A quick analysis on play by play data revealed that NFL Football has become a more entertaining sport than it was 20 years ago.\n\n\n.@reinhurdler posted that this NFL week was particularly boring (and he was right) Then @Unmalkicker suggested it would be interesting to see yearly evolution of data to see if it is becoming a more entertaining sport. Turns out, the NFL is SLIGHLTY more fun in recent years. pic.twitter.com/qdijTN4vf7\n\n— Pablo L. Landeros (@Landeros_p33) October 27, 2021\n\n\n\n🔷 Comeback Probability using Monte Carlo Simulation  Using Poisson distribution and Monte Carlo simulation, I predicted the probability of UNAM coming back from a 4 goal deficit against Cruz Azul in the Mexican Cup semifinals. Our predicted probabilities matched those published by betting sites.\n\n\n⚽️Usando Simulación Monte Carlo + la idea de @migueldva de ajustar una distribución Poisson para simular partidos de futbol. ⚽️📊Nos aventamos 10,000 simulaciones para estimar cuáles eran las probabilidades de que @PumasMX avanzara a la final: pic.twitter.com/zzR1nIMX4V\n\n— Pablo L.

Landeros (@Landeros_p33) September 17, 2020\n\n\n\n🔷 Elevator Probabilities \nIf 10 people take an elevator in a 5 story building. What is the probability that none of them get out of the elevator in the first two floors? Through simulation, we can get an answer.\n\n\nAquí están mis códigos en #RStats y según yo la probabilidad de que nadie baje en los primeros dos pisos es de 6.59 % 😋Mañana lo intento con Monte Carlo a ver que sale.Dejo mi repo de Github por si alguien le interesa:https://t.co/bvsXIrcB0f https://t.co/4StVkn6r9Z pic.twitter.com/OBS3WXOBOe\n\n— Pablo L.
